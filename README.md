# Hassaku-Emulator
The world's first Switch 2 Emulator.

Have any concerns about the project? Please contact me at ``solardotsh@proton.me``
And nintendo, if you have any concerns, please also contact me on that.


Hassaku is an early and WIP Switch 2 Emulator made in C#

We will fully release this (and its source code) once we get a few more games in-game, as we dont want to risk getting a DMCA instantly and people being left with (basically) nothing. You can view progress in our discord:
